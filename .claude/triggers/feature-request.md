# Feature Request: User Profile Enhancement

## Overview
We need to enhance our user profile service with additional profile customization features to improve user engagement and personalization.

## Requirements

### 1. Avatar Upload System
- Allow users to upload profile avatars
- Support common image formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)
- Basic image validation
- Store avatar URL in user profile

### 2. Bio/Description Field
- Add a biographical description field to user profiles
- Character limit: 500 characters
- Basic input validation and sanitization
- Display bio on profile view

### 3. Social Links Section
- Enable users to add social media links
- Support common platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)
- URL validation
- Display as clickable links on profile

### 4. Privacy Controls
- Allow users to control profile visibility
- Settings: public, private, friends-only
- Apply privacy settings to profile data
- Default to public for backward compatibility

## Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing User model
- Use existing Express.js + in-memory storage architecture
- Each feature should be independently testable
- No database migrations required (in-memory only)

## Success Criteria
- All 4 features implemented and working
- API endpoints for each feature
- Basic validation in place
- Tests pass
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
